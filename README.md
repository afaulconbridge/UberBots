Construction bots are great.

But.

Don't you think that their range is a little limited? To use effectively, you have to build and place a lot of roboports to support them - enough
that you have to plan that into the design of your factory, when really what you want to do is be scaling up and not tweaking designs that worked 
perfectly well before. 

However, just increasing the range isn't enough. At a certain point, bots run out of power before they reach their destination, and then have to 
come back, recharge, try again, and run out of power again.

To stop this feeling , this mod increases the consturction range of roboports - up to 4x the previous range, which is 16x the previous area. 
Also, roboports now recharge 25 robots at once 4 times as fase, and have a power draw and store to match! To use this, robots have 10x the energy store they did previously.
